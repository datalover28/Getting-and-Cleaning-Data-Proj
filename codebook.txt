Script
 First I have merged the test and train datasets 
 then I changed first two column's name
 then I subsetted the columns containing only mean() and std() features
 then I gave labels to the activites
 then to make tidy dataset I made Features and Value Column which contains all the observations of the features and their corresponding values resp 
 then by grouping them i summarized it with respect to mean of the values


TIDY DATA SET
There are total 4 Variables in the dataset
1) Subject
  There are total 30 subjects 1 to 30
2) Activites
  Each Subject Performs 6 activities 
     WALKING

     WALKING_UPSTAIRS
 
     WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
  
     SITTING
  
     STANDING
  
     LAYING
 
3) Feature
  These are the different features which are calculated on each activity

4) Value
  It's the mean values of the values of the feature for each activity for each subject
